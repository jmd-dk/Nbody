### Abstract

<img align="right" height="250" src="/concept/docs/_static/render2D.png"/>

CO*N*CEPT (**CO**smological ***N***-body **C**od**E** in **P**y**T**hon) is a
free and open-source simulation code for cosmological structure formation. The
code should run on any Linux system, from massively parallel computer clusters
to laptops. The code is written almost exclusively in Python, but achieves
C-like performance through code transformation using a custom
transpiler/optimizer and [Cython].

CO*N*CEPT is capable of simulating matter particles evolving under
self-gravity in an expanding background. It has multiple gravitational solvers
to choose from, and has adaptive time integration built in. In addition to
particles, the code is further able to evolve fluids at various levels of
non-linearity, providing the means for the inclusion of more exotic species
such as massive neutrinos. Completely linear perturbations in density fields
and the metric itself allows for simulations consistent with general
relativistic perturbation theory. Various non-standard species &mdash; such as
decaying cold dark matter &mdash; are fully supported.

CO*N*CEPT comes with a sophisticated initial condition generator built in, and
can output snapshots, power spectra and several kinds of renders.

The [CLASS] code is fully integrated into CONCEPT, supplying the needed
information for e.g. initial condition generation and
general relativistic corrections.



### Getting Started
To get started with CO*N*CEPT, walking through the [tutorial] is highly
recommended. That said, installation can be as simple as

```bash
bash <(wget -O- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jmd-dk/concept/master/installer)
```

which installs CO*N*CEPT along with all of its dependencies into a single
directory. The installation takes about an hour or two on modern hardware.
Should the installation process end prematurely, simply rerun the installation
command and it will pick up from where it was.

To run a small sample simulation, navigate to the `concept` directory
and invoke

```bash
./concept -p params/example_params -n 2 --local
```

This will run the simulation defined by the provided `example_params`
parameter file using 2 processes.

Consult the [tutorial] and the rest of the [documentation]
for further guidance.
